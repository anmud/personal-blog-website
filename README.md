- creating overall structure of the project (directories & files). Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on page and functionality, as well as separates css files based on element's styling
- linking CSS files to HTML files
- importing CSS files into another style file
- using Flexbox and Grid to easily create a layout
- applying responsive web design via media queries. Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- there is an intentional user flow on each page with appropriate links as needed
- using HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` , etc. are used to add meaning to the code.
